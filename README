files:
edge.cpp -> edge server receives client connections, distributes queries to backend servers and responds to client on receiving computation results
client.cpp -> initiates the queries to edge server, receives response from the edge server directly; takes query-filename as input
server_and.cpp -> responsible for AND computations
server_or.cpp -> responsible for OR computations

temp files generated:
or.txt, and.txt
	These files are the result of splitting the main query file from client into two parts. Format for each line - <lineNumber, operand1, operand2>

or_results.txt, and_results.txt
	These files are used to temporarily store the results of OR and AND computatons. Format for each line - <linNumber, result>. 

results.txt
or_results.txt and and_results.txt files are merged by the edge server, deleting line numbers in the process to generate the results to return to client
